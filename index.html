<h2>About Me / Introduction</h2>
<p>My name is Nicolas Navia, I am 17 years old and I am a junior studying in Santa Cruz International School in Santa Cruz, Bolivia. This page is about me, who I am, and what I like. I like baking, running, feeling productive, listening to music, watching movies, and doing whatever I feel like in the moment. Currently I’m committed to my future and I’m trying to get into a good university.</p>
